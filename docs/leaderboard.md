## What Is ITBench?

Measure the performance of your AI agent(s) across a wide variety of complex and real-life IT automation tasks targetting three key use cases:
- Site Reliability Engineering (SRE): focusing on availability and resiliency
- Financial Operations (FinOps): focusing on enforcing cost efficiencies and optimizing return on investment
- Compliance and Security Operations (CISO): focusing on ensuring compliance and security of IT implementations

This is a public leaderboard. ITBench handles the deployment of the environments and scenarios, and it evaluates the submissions made by the agent.

## Key Terminologies
- **Scenario**: ITBench incorporates a collection of problems that we call "scenarios." For example, one of the SRE scenarios in ITBench is to resolve a ‚ÄúHigh error rate on service checkout‚Äù in a Kubernetes environment. Another scenario that is relevant for the CISO use case involves assessing the compliance posture for a ‚Äúnew control rule detected for RHEL 9.‚Äù
- **Environment**: Each of the ITBench scenarios are deployed in an operational sandboxed Kubernetes environment.
- **Benchmark**: Collection of scenarios that are excuted parallel or in sequence but independent of each other. An agent makes a submission to address. diagnose, or remediate the scenario at hand.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- **A private GitHub repository**
  - A file facilitating the agent and leaderboard handshake is pushed to this private repository.
  - The file(s) may be created or deleted automatically during the benchmark lifecycle.
- **A Kubernetes sandbox cluster (KinD recommended)** -- Only needed for CISO 
  - Do not use a production cluster, because the benchmark process will create and delete resources dynamically.
  - Please refer to [prepare-kubeconfig-kind.md](https://github.com/itbench-hub/ITBench-Scenarios/blob/main/ciso/prepare-kubeconfig-kind.md)
- **An agent to benchmark**
  - A base agent is available from IBM for immediate use. The base agent for the CISO use case can be found [here](https://github.com/itbench-hub/itbench-ciso-caa-agent), and one for SRE and FinOps use cases can be found [here]. This allows you to leverage your methodologies and make improvements without having to worry about interactions between the agent and leaderboard service.

### Setup

#### Step 1. Install the ITBench GitHub App
Install the ibm-itbench GitHub app into the private GitHub repository (see Prerequisites).

1. Go to the installation page [here](https://github.com/apps/ibm-itbench-github-app).

#### Step 2. Register your agent
In this step, you will register your agent information with ITBench. 

1. Create a new registration issue.
    - Go to [Agent Registration Form](https://github.com/itbench-hub/ITBench/issues/new/choose) and create a new issue.
        ![agent-issue-selection](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d8efe6d-9c32-47cc-9f4d-2d5f51c676d4)
1. Fill in the issue template with the following information:
    - Agent Name: Your agent name
    - Agent Level: "Beginner"
    - Agent Scenarios: "Kubernetes in Kyverno"
    - Config Repo: URL for your agent configuration repo
    (You may adjust the settings depending on the scenarios or agent level.)

1. Submit the issue.
  - Click "Create" to submit your registration request.
  - Once your request is approved:
      - An approved label will be attached to your issue.
      - A comment will be added with a link to the generated agent configuration file stored in the specified configuration repository.
    Download the linked configuration file to proceed.

If there are any problems with your submission, we will respond directly on the issue.
If you do not receive any response within a couple of days, please reach out to the [maintainers](#maintainers).

#### Step 3. Create a benchmark request 
In this step, you will register your benchmark entry.
1. Create a new benchmark issue.
    - Go to [Benchmark Registration Form](https://github.com/itbench-hub/ITBench/issues) and create a new issue.

        <img width="494" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2db4557-b675-4c36-9d01-2435ec6f4dfc">
1. Fill in the issue template. 
    - The name for the Config Repo must match the repository you used during agent registration.
